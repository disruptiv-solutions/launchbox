- [x] **Auth integration** - Proper user creation and tenant assignment
- [x] **API endpoint testing** - Subdomain availability API functionality

## Recent Updates (Admin + Tenant Routing) ✅
- [x] Tenant-aware middleware added to enforce subdomain in prod and path prefix on localhost; rewrites tenant URLs to base routes in dev to prevent 404s
- [x] Environment validation for Firebase; prevents invalid API key issues and avoids duplicate init
- [x] Sidebar navigation made tenant-aware; links prefix with `/{tenantId}` in dev
- [x] Admin toggle and links updated to use tenant-aware routing
- [x] Admin dashboard tiles removed; navigation centralized in sidebar
- [x] Firestore rules aligned with code collection names (`communityPosts`, `comments`, `userProgress`) and tenant isolation tightened
- [x] Admin stats scoped to current tenant to satisfy Firestore security rules
- [x] Excluded `/.well-known` from middleware handling to avoid noisy logs
